Final P0.67 Test - Upstream Tracking Verification
=====================================================

This file tests if the "6 ahead" issue is fixed.

Expected behavior after push:
- Upstream tracking: origin/main (already configured ✓)
- Status should show: ahead: 0 (everything synced)
- "6 ahead" message should be gone

Test timestamp: $(date)
